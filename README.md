### Experience overview (most recent first)

##### With Laravel 4:
1. Worked on developing a few internal facing applications, along with work done on creating and polishing REST APIs. Helped complete many deep features and solved data level problems and bugs with systems.

##### With AngularJS:
1. Worked on integrating RequireJS and AngularJS, and helped complete a large, reusable 'backoffice' (administration UI) that worked in conjunction with the REST APIs.

2. After writing a jQuery application for the rockn signup project (details below), I was looking for a change to cleaner code that was easier to maintain. So we [rebuilt in Angular](http://signup.rocknjobz.com). Modular and much shorter code was the result. I have a great bias toward using Angular on any new project now.

3. An exploratory UI for an app called [Peeplocal](http://dev.peeplocal.com/). This was a jQuery plugin we saw elsewhere that I recreated as a directive.

##### With Laravel 3:

1. A backend for the jQuery based signup area of [Rocknjobz](http://dev.rocknjobz.com/signup/) (was still under construction when we changed tracks).

I have worked on creating a scalable infrastructure for hosting openstreetmap servers (similar to the work of mapbox), sysadmin oriented work. The plan was to start a SaaS offering for hosted maps.

##### With CodeIgniter:

1. Had built a Workflow management system, customized for one particular Italian bank's requirements.
2. Built a 'goal tracking' app, similar to HabitRPG but [less complex](http://achieve.joosab.com/).

##### With Drupal:

1. I had built a 'casesheet management system', distributed to a couple Physiotherapy clinics. It allows doctors and their staff to fill out a form with the patient's detailed case history, and later browse these. A digitization of the usual paper-based way of doing things.
2. Had written a module to change how checkout works, to provide custom prorated pricing depending on actual dates of utilization, for [these guys](http://cloudvirtualoffice.com).

3. Wrote a module for selecting items from a hotel's menu.

Some of these were subcontracts, some private apps, some have been discontinued. I've provided links where possilbe. I've also done a large amount of non-complex website work, in addition to some ancient, custom-built PHP apps, admittedly many of those are offline, so I have skipped mentioning them.
