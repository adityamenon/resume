## Quick overview

### Most important work

##### Ongoing work on Logistics Software for honestbee

I help build frontend UI and backend API features with TDD principles for internal facing Logistics tools, while keeping in mind the needs of multiple stakeholder dimensions.

##### Rewrite of a legacy codebase in ReactJS & Node.js

I rewrote the entire stack of a budding startup that was struggling with an unscalable, buggy codebase consisting of PHP and jQuery code, to a React/Redux based frontend and AWS powered Node.js backend infrastructure. They launched within weeks and achieved seed funding shortly after.

Main technologies utilized: **ReactJS, Redux, ES6**, **Node.js**, **Amazon AWS include**

##### Worked on the Backend for Gut Checkâ„¢ app (Johnson & Johnson)

An app that helps IBD patients report treatment outcomes to their specialists in a convenient, consistent & secure way. I implemented a complex architecture for authentication & data flow, while helping out with production grade infrastructure building for the APIs.

Main technologies utilized: **Node.js & Mongo based mBaaS**, **HIPAA Storage APIs**, **Laravel 4**, **Amazon AWS**, **Angular JS**

### Some technology I've built, listed most recent to oldest

#### Systems that were divided in two parts: an API backend, and an independent JS frontend.

##### An Industry-level Data Management system.
Backend:

    + An "API to represent entire industries".
    + Serving more than 30 different endpoints.
    + Served multiple kinds of stakeholders, with each kind having different levels of requirements.
    + Allowed higher level stakeholders to manage access control on lower levels.
    + A flexible taxonomy system based on the concepts of Tags and Tag Categories.
    + A flexible data-asset management system based on the above taxonomy system.
Frontend:

    + About 20 screens, with many different interactive elements.
    + Token based access management system.

Main technologies utilized: **Laravel 4**, **Angular JS**

##### B2B marketplace.
Outline:

    + Listing of several categories of offerings to be browsed.
    + Endpoints allowed querying of data by various parameters.
    + Access control system.

Key skills learned:

    + Building an ecommerce like viewing layout with AngularJS.
    + Implemented a token based authentication scheme that allowed frontend to track server sessions.

Main technologies utilized: **Laravel 4**, **Angular JS**

##### CRM application built for a car rental company.
Outline:

    + App to manage Clients, Contracts, Assets and Employees of the company.
    + Provided CRUD operations and PDF generation for each category.
    + Managed data relationships between these entities.

Main technologies utilized: **Laravel 4**, **Angular JS**

##### Legal Document and Compliance Management system
Outline:

    + App for a major retailer to manage legal compliance status for a global network of suppliers.
    + Two different frontends for the retailer vs. the suppliers.
    + Emailing system that kept track of non-compliant suppliers and sent reminders to ensure they did.

Key skills learned:

    + Implemented a highly secure JWT based authentication scheme: http://security.stackexchange.com/q/64541/5611

Main technologies utilized: **Laravel 4**, **Angular JS**

#### Plain systems without a separate frontend being served

##### Codebase rewrite for a Cryptocurrency marketplace
Outline:

    + Laravel rewrite commissioned for a cryptocurrency marketplace written in plain PHP.
    + Project abandoned due to time constraints of client, but I learnt a few things when building this.

Key skills learned:

    + Built social login into the system.
    + Built a 2 factor auth system integration into the social login, as of this writing no such package exists yet for Laravel.

Main technologies utilized: **Laravel 4**, **Cartalyst\Arsenal**, **GAuthify**

#### Older pieces of experience

##### AngularJS
+ After writing a jQuery application for the rockn signup project (details below), I was looking for a change to cleaner code that was easier to maintain. So we rebuilt in Angular. Modular and much shorter code was the result. This was my first intro to Angular.
+ An exploratory UI for an event info app. This was a jQuery plugin we saw elsewhere that I recreated as an Angular directive.

##### Sysadmin and Linux:

+ Worked on creating a scalable infrastructure for hosting openstreetmap servers (similar to the work of mapbox). The plan was to start a SaaS offering for hosted maps. We had the technology down, but we did not develop the SaaS platform to sell it out of.

##### CodeIgniter:

+ Had built a Workflow management system, customized for one particular Italian bank's requirements.
+ Built a 'goal tracking' app, similar to HabitRPG but less complex.

##### Drupal:

+ I had built a 'casesheet management system', distributed to a couple Physiotherapy clinics. It allows doctors and their staff to fill out a form with the patient's detailed case history, and later browse these. A digitization of the usual paper-based way of doing things.
+ Had written a module to change how checkout works, to provide custom prorated pricing depending on actual dates of utilization, for CloudVirtualOffice.

I've also done a large amount of non-complex website work, in addition to some ancient, custom-built PHP apps, admittedly many of those are offline, so I have skipped mentioning them.
